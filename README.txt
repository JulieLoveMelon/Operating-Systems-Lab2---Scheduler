This repository includes four files, scheduler.cpp, lab1-sched-fall2018.pdf, Makefile and README.txt.
The pdf is the requirements for the lab from the instructer of the course. 
scheduler.cpp is the main file which contains the source code satisfying the demands in the pdf.
Makefile organizes code compilation for the Linux system. 
In the lab, I implemented different scheduling policies on a set of processes/threads executing on a system using Discrete Event Simulation. The scheduling algorithms which I simulated are FCFS (First Come First Served), LCFS (Last Come First Served), SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time Next), RR (Round Robin), PRIO (Priority Scheduler) and PREemptive PRIO (PREPRIO).
